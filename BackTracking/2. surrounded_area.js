/* Problem: Given a 2D board containing 'X' and 'O' (the letter O), capture all regions surrounded by 'X'.

  A region is captured by flipping all 'O's into 'X's in that surrounded region.

  Example:
    X X X X
    X O O X
    X X O X
    X O X X

  After running your function, the board should be:

    X X X X
    X X X X
    X X X X
    X O X X

Explanation:
  - Surrounded regions shouldnâ€™t be on the border, which means that any 'O' on the border of the board are not flipped to 'X'.
  - Any 'O' that is not on the border and it is not connected to an 'O' on the border will be flipped to 'X'.
  - Two cells are connected if they are adjacent cells connected horizontally or vertically.


  Idea: Backtracking and start with starting and ending index of row and columns and find if there is any ajdecent O's, if there replace it temp var

// Time Complexity: O(N^2), as in worst case we will be visiting all rows and columns
// Space Complexity: O(1)
